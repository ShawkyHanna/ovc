* it would be nice to see CRC_ERROR for configuration debugging
* add silkscreen mark for VN-100 orientation
* HSEXP 7 +/- go into bank 2L, which is a 3V bank and doesn't have differential
  input series termination available.
  HSEXP7+/- should go into any other bank instead.
* remove solder paste from IMU footprints and C5 footprint (within VN-100)
* cam2 MOSI/MISO are swapped
* bring IMU_SYNC_OUT to 100mil header instead of (or in addition to) SYNC_IN
