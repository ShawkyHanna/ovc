Bugs found in rev.A that need to be fixed:
* ground the microSD card write-protect, so we don't have to hack the driver
* add meanders to correct pair skew for PCIe, HDMI, GbE, USB3, USB2
* R35, R34 should be 4R99
* Ethernet pairs might need to be swapped back to their original assignments and polarity; it's not clear that it's OK to swap them for a convenient layout.
* Move capacitor at lower-right of FPGA slightly further away to give some
  more clearance around the heatsink retainer clip
