PCB Fabrication notes:
=====================
* Lead time: 4 days
* Fab quantity: full panel yield (presumably this will be 20 or so?)
* Board outline is a rectangle, 1.301" x 1.397"
* 10 layers
* micro-vias between the outermost layers (layers 1+2, and layer 9+10).
* All other vias are through-vias.
* 62 mil PCB thickness
* Copper weights are not critical (everything is relatively low-power). However, impedances are important due to DDR3 and other high-speed traces.
* stackup was started using the included "stackup.pdf" report generated by Sierra's "HDI Stackup Planner" website. We do require the following impedances for these trace widths and layer pairs (+/- 10%)
  * layer 1:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 2:  solid ground plane
  * layer 3:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 4:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 5:  split power planes
  * layer 6:  split power planes
  * layer 7:  some planes and some 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 8:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 9:  solid ground plane
  * layer 10: signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm

* Minimum trace/space is 5mil.
* All holes plated
* Minimum via-drill 7 mil, minimum via-pad 13 mil
* Minimum micro-via drill 6 mil, minimum micro-via pad 13 mil
* FR4 material
* HASL finish
* Green soldermask both sides
* White silkscreen both sides
