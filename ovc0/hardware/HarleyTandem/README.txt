Project: harley_tandem, rev. B
(This is a trinocular camera sensor board.)

=============================
PCB Fabrication notes:
=============================
* Lead time: 4 days
* Board outline is a rectangle with a rectangular protrusion on the north side.
* Bounding box is 9.40" x 1.54"
* 6 layers:
  * layer 1 = signal with 7-mil 50-ohm traces relative to layer 2
  * layer 2 = full plane
  * layer 3 = mixed (signal and partial planes)
  * layer 4 = mixed (signal and partial planes)
  * layer 5 = full plane
  * layer 6 = signal with 7-mil 50-ohm traces relative to layer 5
* Controlled stackup, using the included "harley_tandem_stackup_rev_b.pdf" report
  generated by Sierra's "HDI Stackup Planner" website. PLEASE NOTE however that
  I was unable to generate the report I wanted from the website; we want 7-mil
  traces on the outer layers (1 & 6) to be 50 ohm +/- 10% with respect to the
  planes on layers 2 & 5. This will likely need a slightly different stackup
  than that shown on the report.
  * 61mil PCB thickness.
  * 7mil traces on outer layer (1 & 6) need to be 50 ohm +/- 10% with respect to
    the planes on layers 2 & 5. The dielectric thickness between
    layers 1&2 and 5&6 will likely need to be slightly thicker than shown on
    the report to get within 10% (or better) of 50mil impedance.
* Layer thicknesses as specified in the stackup report: { 1, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 1 }
* Minimum trace/space is 5mil.
* All holes plated
* Minimum via-drill 8 mil, minimum via-pad 16 mil. Most vias are >= 24mil
* FR4 material
* HASL finish
* Green soldermask both sides
* White silkscreen both sides
* RoHS processing is fine but not necessary; these are laboratory prototypes.
