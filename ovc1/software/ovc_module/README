altera_cvp -- Linux driver for configuring Altera FPGAs via CvP
---------------------------------------------------------------
Driver version:  1.1.0 (12/1/2015)
Release version: 1.1.0 (12/1/2015)


Description:
------------
The altera_cvp driver allows a Linux user to configure the core of an Altera
CvP-capable FPGA through the use of standard Unix utilities or custom-built
user-space applications. 


Installation:
-------------
In the directory where the release files are located, run the following commands:

1) make
2) make install [vid=<PCI vendor ID> did=<PCI device ID>] (this step requires
                                                           root privileges)

The PCI vendor and device ID parameters are optional. If no PCI vendor and
device IDs are specified when the driver is installed, the driver will use the
following default values:

Vendor ID: 0x1172 (Altera vendor ID)
Device ID: 0xE001 (Altera PCIe high-performance reference design device ID)


Uninstall:
----------
To uninstall the driver, run the following commands (both require root privileges):

1) /sbin/rmmod altera_cvp
2) rm -f /dev/altera_cvp


Usage:
------
The cvp driver is accessible through the device file located at /dev/altera_cvp.

Reading from this file will return a binary representation of the VSEC registers
for CvP. Writing to this file will cause any data written between file open and
close to be sent to the FPGA as CvP core configuration data.

This allows the use of standard Unix utilities like cp to perform CvP, for example:

cp <filename>.core.rbf /dev/altera_cvp

The command above will cause the driver to attempt a CvP configuration of the
FPGA using the specified core RBF file.


Not currently supported:
------------------------
* Concurrent access to the device (multiple processes/users)
* ioctl system calls
