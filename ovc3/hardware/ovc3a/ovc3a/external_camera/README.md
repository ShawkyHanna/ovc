# Lens holders
Lens holders have 20mm spacing. There are various options that work fine.
We have used PT-LH010M from m12lenses.com with good results:

# FFC jumpers
The required length of jumper depends on how the external-camera board is
mounted with respect to the main OVC3 board. We have used Molex 15266-0281
for 6" length (about 150mm) but many other alternatives are possible.
